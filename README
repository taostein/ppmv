Very fast rendering of PPMs on any system supporting X11
Designed for making digital art works, because that requires exploration

== Build

Compile with "make"

If you have trouble building, it's probably because the X11 include path is wrong. Fix the X11_ROOT variable in the Makefile

If your Xlib.h is at /opt/X11/include/X11/Xlib.h then X11_ROOT should be /opt/X11/

== Run

Once built, you need to have an X11 XServer running for this to run

Run with:

cat raimu.ppm | ./ppmv

or:

./ppmv raimu.ppm

or:

./ppmv raimu.ppm -s 10
cat raimu.ppm | ./ppmv - -s 10

The above two will close the window and exit after 10 seconds
